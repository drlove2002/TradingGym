## Types of Contributions
We welcome the following types of contributions:

## Code Style
Please follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) when writing code for the `TradingGym` package.

## Testing
We encourage contributions that include appropriate unit tests, and we plan to implement a testing framework in the near future using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

To run tests locally once they are implemented, simply navigate to the root directory of the `TradingGym` repository and run `pytest`. We ask that all contributions include passing unit tests before they are submitted for review.

Please note that we currently do not have any unit tests, but we plan to add them in the future.

## Code Reviews
As the sole maintainer of the TradingGym repository, all pull requests will be reviewed by [me](https://github.com/drlove2002) aka @drlove2002. You may ask for revisions or further changes before merging a pull request. We encourage open and constructive communication during the code review process to ensure that all contributions are of the highest quality.
